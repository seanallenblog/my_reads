# MyReads Project

This project allows a user to select a limited number of books provided by an api and add, move, or
remove them from one of three categories (or shelves) based on the user's preferences. Categories include
**Want to Read**, **Currently Reading**, **Read**, and **None**. When the **None** category is selected
the targeted book will be removed from the current shelf.

To start using the app:
* Clone the repository onto your local machine.
* Change into the cloned directory.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
